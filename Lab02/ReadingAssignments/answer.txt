When should accessor methods be used?
Accessor methods (getters and setters) should only be used for variables and methods that need to be accessed by clients of the class. 
If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Yes, Java allows creating multiple constructor methods within a class as long as they have different method signatures. This is constructor overloading.
